The scenario of our game consists of two goals in the court, the two different balls that spawn randomly and the timer. Each player needs to 
take the ball and take it to their goal to score points before the timer ends. For the assets, we used images for the court and the balls
We still need to work on the ball prefab as the only ball that can go on the goal is the original.

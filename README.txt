The scenario of our game consists of two goals in the court, the two different balls that spawn randomly and the timer. Each player needs to 
take the ball and take it to their goal to score points before the timer ends. For the assets, we used images for the court and the balls
We still need to work on the ball prefab as the only ball that can go on the goal is the original.

For this second submission we have totally finished Level 1 by adding a new scoreboard, background sounds and sound effects related to the ball. We have almost finished level 2 by adding random movement to the balls and exterior walls in order to make them collide and avoid letting them going out the court. Level 3 is also started by adding black balls to stamp it and adding extra points. This level is still in development.
